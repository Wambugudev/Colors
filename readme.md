#Colors

This is an application I did while still learning laravel and I was proud that I was able to complete it on my own.

#How to run

1. Create a database in xampp called test_colors
2. run php artisan migrate
3. run php artisan serve
4. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000

When refreshing the colors change randomly.
